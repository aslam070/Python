Optimizing Hotel Revenue with Booking Cancellation

This project aims to analyze hotel booking data to identify patterns in cancellations and build a model to optimize revenue by predicting and mitigating potential losses due to cancellations.

Project Structure:-

Optimizing Hotel Revenue with Booking Cancellation

- train.csv                                ( Training dataset)
- optimizing-hotel-revenue-with-booking-cancellation (3).ipynb  ( Main Jupyter Notebook)
- cleaned_dataset.csv                      ( Cleaned dataset used for analysis and modeling)
- README.md                                ( Project documentation)

Objectives:-

1.Analyze booking data to find trends in cancellations

2.Clean and preprocess the dataset

3.Explore features that influence cancellations

4.Build and evaluate classification models

5.Provide recommendations for revenue optimization

Tools & Technologies:-

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook ,google colab and kaggle

Key Steps:-

Data Cleaning:

1.Handled missing values and outliers

2.Encoded categorical variables

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

1.Visualized relationships between features

2.Identified high-risk cancellation factors

Modeling:

1.Built models using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost

2.Compared model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Result:

- Best model identified for cancellation prediction

- Insights provided to improve hotel revenue management

Results & Insights:-

1.Guests with special requests and longer stays had lower cancellation rates.

2.Bookings without a deposit or with long lead times had higher cancellation risks.

3.Random Forest showed the best performance in predicting cancellations.

Conclusion:-

By understanding cancellation patterns and applying predictive models, hotels can better manage bookings, reduce last-minute cancellations, and maximize revenue.
